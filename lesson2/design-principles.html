                    <h3>Alignment</h3>
                    <h4>Spotify</h4>
                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com">www.spotify.com</a>
                </div>
                <img src="images/Spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify home page">
                <p>
                    Spotify is a good example of alignment design.<br>
                    All the elements (images) are properly laid out on a grid.
                    This gives an impression of well-ordered content and gives a really good readability to the whole page.
                    In addition to that, the contrast is very good: the elements stand out and are clearly identified.
                </p>

            <div class="card">

                    <h3>Contrast</h3>
                    <h4>Qwant</h4>
                    <a href="https://www.qwant.com">www.qwant.com</a>
                </div>
                <img src="images/Qwant.jpg" alt="Qwant home page">
                <p>
                    Qwant is an example of a good use of contrast.<br>
                    The search bar stands out as it contrasts from the background.
                    The cards catch the eye with another contrasting color but not dissonant.
                    Thanks to the contrast, the information is clearly and quickly assimilated.
                    This page also uses a bit of clean design as there is not too much information at once and ther is white space around the different elements.
                    This adds to the cleanliness of the page.
                </p>

                    <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
                    <h4>WeTransfer</h4>
                    <a href="https://wetransfer.com/upload">www.wetransfer.com</a>
                </div>
                <img src="images/WeTransfer.jpg" alt="WeTransfer upload page">
                <p>
                    The WeTransfer site, and more specifically the upload page, is a good example of use of white space and clean design.<br>
                    There is a lot of space left empty: except for a minimalist title bar (with only three elements), there is only one centered button with very few words.
                    This is a great call to action. You do not need a PhD to understand that there is only one thing to do: hit that button!
                    This is super straight forward and does simplify the user's experience without distraction: you are here to do only one thing and to do it efficiently.
